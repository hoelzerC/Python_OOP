# Object-Oriented Programming in Python

__Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming in Python Tutorial Session!__

Hi there! We're glad you've decided to join us for this tutorial session on object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.

The tutorial will be led by Christian HÃ¶lzer and Marvin Friede, two PhD students in the Grimme lab who are excited to share their knowledge on OOP with you.

During the session, we will be using a combination of slides and Jupyter notebooks to introduce you to the concepts of OOP in Python. The slides will provide a high-level overview of the key concepts, and the Jupyter notebooks will allow you to see these concepts in action with interactive examples and exercises.

We hope that by the end of the session, you will have a good understanding of OOP in Python, and will feel confident using these concepts in your own projects.

We look forward to learning with you!

Best,
Christian and Marvin
